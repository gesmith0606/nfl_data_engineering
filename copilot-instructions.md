## � Data Pipeline Stages with MCP Integration

### Bronze Layer (Raw Ingestion) ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Purpose:** Ingest unprocessed data directly from nfl-data-py to your `nfl-raw` S3 bucket

**Current Implementation:**
1. **Local Python Execution:** Run scripts locally with command-line parameters
2. **NFL Data Fetching:** Use nfl-data-py library to get game/player data  
3. **S3 Storage:** Direct upload to `s3://nfl-raw/` using boto3
4. **Partitioning:** Organize by `games/season=YYYY/week=WW/` structure
5. **Format:** Parquet files for efficient storage and querying

**Current Data Inventory:**
- ✅ **16 NFL games** from 2023 Week 1 (complete game metadata)
- ✅ **2,816 plays** with full play-by-play details (down, distance, yards, outcome)  
- ✅ **0.21 MB** in S3 with proper partitioning
- ✅ **Data validated** and ready for Silver layer transformation

**Execution Pattern:**
```bash
python scripts/bronze_ingestion_simple.py --season 2023 --week 1 --data-type schedules
python scripts/bronze_ingestion_simple.py --season 2023 --week 1 --data-type pbp
```
