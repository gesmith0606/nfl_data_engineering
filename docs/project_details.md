# NFL Data Engineering Project - Implementation Log

## Project Infrastructure Summary

### AWS S3 Buckets (us-east-2)
- **Bronze Layer:** `nfl-raw` - Raw data ingestion
- **Silver Layer:** `nfl-refined` - Cleaned and standardized data  
- **Gold Layer:** `nfl-trusted` - Business-ready aggregations

### Databricks Configuration
- **Workspace URL:** `dbc-c9b1be11-c0c8.cloud.databricks.com`
- **User:** `smithge0606@gmail.com`
- **Current Plan:** Community Edition (learning mode only)
- **Limitation:** No direct S3 access, DBFS only
- **Upgrade Path:** Standard/Premium for production S3 integration

### Development Architecture
- **Primary Mode:** Local Python development with direct S3 integration
- **Storage:** AWS S3 with dedicated buckets per medallion layer
- **Compute:** Local Python environment using boto3 for S3 operations
- **Future Scaling:** Ready for Databricks Standard upgrade when needed

- `src/config.py` - Specific S3 bucket configuration

#### ðŸ¤– MCP Configuration - All MCPs Successfully Installed
**Files Modified:**
- `.vscode/mcp.json` - Three working MCP servers configured

**MCP Servers Status:**
- âœ… **Filesystem MCP** - WORKING (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@2025.7.29`)
- âœ… **Sequential Thinking MCP** - WORKING (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking@2025.7.1`)
- âœ… **Puppeteer MCP** - WORKING (`puppeteer-mcp-server@0.7.2`)

**Installation Method:**
- Used `npm install -g` to properly install MCP servers globally
- All three servers now available via npx commands
- Configuration tested and confirmed working

**Documentation Updates:**
- `README.MD` updated with MCP setup instructions and enhanced capabilities
- `copilot-instructions.md` updated with MCP integration patterns and workflows
- `requirements.txt` updated with web scraping dependencies and MCP installation notes
- All documentation now reflects complete MCP-enabled development environment

**Current MCP Capabilities:**
- **File Management:** Complete project file and directory operations
- **Problem Solving:** Sequential thinking assistance for complex pipeline issues
- **Web Browser Automation:** NFL data scraping, validation, and monitoring
- **Future Enhancements:** Ready for betting odds, weather data, news sentiment analysis

#### ðŸ“‹ Development Planning
**Files Created:**
- `project_details.md` - Implementation tracking and decisions log
- `development_tasks.md` - Complete MVP task breakdown (11-day timeline)

**Key Changes Implemented:**

#### 1. README.MD Updates
- **Architecture Section:** Updated to reflect local Python + S3 approach instead of Databricks-first
- **Prerequisites:** Added specific bucket names (`nfl-raw`, `nfl-refined`, `nfl-trusted`) and workspace URL
- **Setup Instructions:** Modified for AWS CLI configuration with us-east-2 region
- **Execution Steps:** Changed from Databricks notebook execution to local Python command-line execution
- **Development Mode:** Added clear distinction between local development and future Databricks upgrade

#### 2. requirements.txt Enhancements  
- **Local Development Focus:** Enhanced boto3, pyarrow, pandas for S3 operations
- **Infrastructure Comments:** Added specific bucket names and region references
- **Development Tools:** Added code quality tools (black, flake8, isort)
- **Testing Support:** Added moto for AWS service mocking
- **Future Compatibility:** Commented Databricks-specific packages for easy upgrade

#### 3. copilot-instructions.md Complete Rewrite
- **Project Overview:** Updated with real infrastructure details and local development approach
- **Architecture Description:** Modified for local compute + cloud storage separation
- **Pipeline Stages:** Rewrote Bronze/Silver/Gold descriptions for local Python execution
- **Environment Configuration:** Added specific AWS and S3 integration patterns
- **Migration Strategy:** Added clear upgrade path to Databricks Standard/Premium

#### 4. Configuration Files Updates
- **.env.example:** Updated with real S3 bucket names, us-east-2 region, actual Databricks workspace URL
- **src/config.py:** Modified to use separate buckets for each medallion layer instead of single bucket approach

#### 5. Architecture Decision: Local Development First
**Rationale:**
- Databricks Community Edition cannot access external S3 buckets
- User has dedicated S3 infrastructure ready for immediate use
- Local development provides full control and no monthly costs during development phase
- Clear migration path available when ready for production scale

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Immediate access to dedicated S3 buckets
- âœ… Full control over processing and data flow
- âœ… No additional costs during development
- âœ… Direct AWS integration learning opportunity
- âœ… Production-ready when ready to scale

**Future Upgrade Triggers:**
- Data processing exceeds local compute capacity (>10GB per job)
- Need for distributed computing across multiple nodes
- Require production scheduling and monitoring features
- Team collaboration requirements

---

## Next Implementation Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Environment Setup:** Configure local Python environment with requirements.txt
2. **AWS Connectivity:** Test S3 access to all three buckets
3. **Bronze Layer Implementation:** Create functional data ingestion pipeline
4. **Silver Layer Development:** Implement data cleaning and validation
5. **Gold Layer Analytics:** Build business aggregation layer

### Testing Strategy
- Local unit tests for utility functions
- S3 integration tests with real buckets
- End-to-end pipeline validation with sample data
- Data quality validation at each medallion layer

### Documentation Maintenance
- Update this file with each significant implementation
- Track decisions, challenges, and solutions
- Monitor performance and scalability considerations
- Document upgrade decision points for future Databricks migration
